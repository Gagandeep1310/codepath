My mission is to build a frontend that supports CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on my favorite content creators. My content creators are Twitch streamers, YouTube channels, Instagram personalities, and TikTok accounts.

The purpose of this project is to share at least five creators I think are worth following and give myself the ability to create, update, and delete creators. Each Creator should have:
1. a name
2. a url (the link to their channel or page)
3. a description
4. an imageURL that links to a picture of the creator or some of their content

I used React to create my app, and used PicoCSS to style HTML elements.
